# RegionTPMS
Region based triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) for 3-D printed multiphase bone scaffolds with exact porosity values.

RegionTPMS_ExactPorosityScaffold.nb generates 3D graphics and STL files for scaffolds for the input porosity values.
RegionTPMS_MultiphaseScaffold.nb generates phases based on the defined regions and creates 3D graphics and STL files for additive manufacturing.
RegionTPMS_GradedPorosityScaffold.nb generates 3D graphics and STL files for bone scaffolds with varying porosity (in consideration to the cortical and cancellous bone sections).
