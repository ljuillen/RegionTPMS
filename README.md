# RegionTPMS
--------------
RegionTPMS is a region based triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) project for 3-D printed multiphase bone scaffolds with exact porosity values.
--------------
RegionTPMS_ExactPorosityScaffold.nb generates 3D graphics and STL files for scaffolds for the input porosity values.

RegionTPMS_MultiphaseScaffold.nb generates phases based on the defined regions and creates 3D graphics and STL files for additive manufacturing.

RegionTPMS_GradedPorosityScaffold.nb generates 3D graphics and STL files for bone scaffolds with varying porosity (in consideration to the cortical and cancellous bone sections).
